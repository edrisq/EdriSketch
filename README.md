# Edr-i-Sketch
Etch-A-Sketch implementation in Jack (nand2tetris) programming language.

This application runs on the Hack architecture, as detailed at https://www.nand2tetris.org/. The .jack files can be compiled using the Jack compiler included in the nand2tetris software suite. Once compiled, the entire folder containing the resulting .vm files can be opened in the VM Emulator to run the software.

I suggest setting the speed to "Fast" and "Animate:" to "No animation". After booting, a brief animation will play and instructions for controlling the Edr-i-Sketch will appear on screen.
